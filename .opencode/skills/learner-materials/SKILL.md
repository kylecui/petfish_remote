# Purpose

Produce materials that help learners prepare, follow, and review the course.

# Learner-facing principles

- clarity over completeness
- guidance over internal commentary
- progressive difficulty
- visible takeaways
- no instructor-only information

# Common deliverables

- pre-read
- class handout
- worksheet
- glossary
- recap sheet
- exercise sheet
- FAQ

# Review checks

- Is the language accessible to the target learner?
- Are objectives and expected actions clear?
- Are references to unavailable teacher materials removed?
- Is the material useful outside the live lecture moment?

# Gotchas

- Do not leak answer keys.
- Do not dump raw source notes on the learner.
- Do not assume prior context that was never introduced.
- Do not overload one handout with multiple unrelated purposes.
