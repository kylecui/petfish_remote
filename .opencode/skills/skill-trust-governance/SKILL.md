description: Use this skill when the user asks for skill trust, skill安全, 治理, 可信度, trust scan, governance, risk score, or redline check. It wraps the external trustskills CLI to scan one skill or a root of skills, generate or verify manifests, and return governance decisions with JSON-ready output.

# skill-trust-governance

## Description

`skill-trust-governance` is a governance wrapper skill for the external `trustskills` engine.

Use it to evaluate a skill pack's executable behavior rather than trusting prose alone. It supports single-skill scans, multi-skill root scans, manifest generation, manifest verification, redline checks, and governance-level reporting.

Primary entrypoint:

```bash
uv run .opencode/skills/skill-trust-governance/scripts/trust_scan.py --path <skill-dir>
```

## Triggers/Activation

Trigger this skill when the user asks for any of the following or clearly equivalent intent:

- skill trust
- skill安全
- 治理
- 可信度
- trust scan
- governance
- risk score
- redline check

Also trigger when the user wants to:

- scan one skill before publish
- batch-scan a skills root
- generate trust manifests
- verify existing manifests
- apply a custom governance policy YAML

## Workflow

1. Decide scope: single skill with `--path`, or multi-skill root with `--root`.
2. Decide mode: default scan, `--manifest` for manifest generation, or `--verify` for manifest verification.
3. Run `scripts/trust_scan.py` instead of calling the external CLI ad hoc.
4. If a custom policy is provided, pass it with `--policy`.
5. Use `--detail` for expanded output and `--output` when a Markdown report is needed.
6. Prefer `--json` when the result will be consumed by quality-gate, CI, or other automation.
7. Report the governance level, overall risk score, triggered redlines, and any required follow-up action.

## Must Do

- Use the bundled `scripts/trust_scan.py` wrapper as the default interface.
- Preserve `trustskills` as an external dependency; do not vendor or inline the engine.
- Surface the five governance levels clearly: `allow`, `allow_with_ask`, `sandbox_required`, `manual_review_required`, `deny`.
- Call out redline violations explicitly because they are hard DENY gates.
- If `trustskills` is missing, return install guidance: `uv add trustskills` or `uv pip install trustskills`.
- Use machine-readable JSON output when integrating with quality-gate or other automated checks.

## Must Not Do

- Do not copy `trustskills` source code into the project.
- Do not import `trustskills` directly inside the wrapper; invoke it through subprocess only.
- Do not hide redline violations behind a summary-only response.
- Do not hardcode absolute paths.
- Do not create commands or agents for this pack.
