# Purpose

Write or refine lesson-level course content.

# Default content structure

For each chapter or lesson, cover:

1. teaching objective
2. key terms/concepts
3. explanation path
4. examples or demonstrations
5. common misunderstandings
6. summary
7. optional reflection/exercise

# Authoring behavior

- Write for the target audience's level, not for the source author's level.
- Prefer a teaching progression: definition -> mechanism -> example -> boundary -> takeaway.
- Keep conceptual accuracy and teaching usability aligned.
- Mark places that need diagrams, demos, or labs.

# Review behavior

When reviewing existing content, look for:

- concept gaps
- sequence problems
- weak transitions
- missing examples
- excessive density
- lack of learner checkpoints

# Gotchas

- Do not duplicate the outline file inside every chapter.
- Do not let examples become detached from the core point.
- Do not bury the most important explanation after too much setup.
- Do not assume the chapter is teachable just because it is technically correct.
