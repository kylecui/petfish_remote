# Purpose

Capture and reuse methods that repeatedly work in course development.

# When to use

Activate when the user asks for:

- methodology
- handbook
- playbook
- standard approach
- reusable process
- historical course-development know-how
- packaging prior discussion into a reusable rule set

# Method extraction model

When turning prior work into methodology:

1. identify repeated successful pattern
2. separate principle from one-off detail
3. define trigger conditions
4. define default procedure
5. list common failure modes
6. provide reusable templates or checklists

# Output forms

- one-page method note
- workflow playbook
- review handbook
- decision matrix
- reusable checklist
- trigger examples

# Gotchas

- Do not mistake one project preference for a universal rule.
- Do not make methodology too generic to be operational.
- Do not store historical noise that does not change future behavior.
- Do not collapse QA, QC, pedagogy, and project management into one vague doctrine.
