# Purpose

Convert QA findings into controlled remediation and decision-ready reporting.

# QC workflow

1. ingest findings
2. normalize issue list
3. define remediation action per issue
4. assign status:
   - open
   - in progress
   - fixed
   - verified
   - deferred
5. summarize residual risk
6. generate release/hold recommendation

# Reporting expectations

A QC report should answer:

- what was found
- what was fixed
- what remains
- what risk remains
- whether release is recommended

# Default output structure

```markdown
# QC Report

## Source QA baseline
## Remediation summary
## Issue-by-issue status
## Residual risks
## Release recommendation
## Next review gate
```

# Script support

Use:
`uv run scripts/render_qc_report.py --help`

when the user already has structured QA findings or wants a repeatable Markdown report generated from JSON input.

# Gotchas

- Do not mark issues closed without evidence.
- Do not lose severity information during remediation.
- Do not recommend release while unresolved blockers remain.
- Do not turn a QC report into a raw dump of QA comments.
