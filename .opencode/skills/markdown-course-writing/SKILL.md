# Purpose

Produce durable Markdown artifacts for course development.

# Writing defaults

Use Markdown as the primary authoring format. Favor:

- stable heading hierarchy
- concise tables only when they help comparison
- ordered lists for procedures
- callouts only when the client supports them
- short sections that can be reorganized later

# Standard artifact shapes

Choose the closest template:

- development plan
- syllabus/outline
- lesson chapter
- lab guide
- learner handout
- instructor guide
- QA checklist
- QC report

# Required writing behavior

1. Start from the user's objective, not from a generic template.
2. Make titles operational and specific.
3. Separate:
   - scope
   - audience
   - prerequisites
   - main body
   - outputs
   - review points
4. Preserve explicit placeholders when facts are missing.
5. Keep references and assumptions visible rather than silently inventing detail.

# Formatting rules

- Use ATX headings (`#`, `##`, `###`).
- Avoid jumping heading levels.
- Prefer fenced code blocks with language tags where relevant.
- Use blockquotes only for source excerpts or mandated wording.
- Do not bury key conclusions in paragraphs longer than necessary.

# Conversion rules

When transforming content from PDF, DOCX, images, or notes:

- normalize terminology
- remove obvious duplication
- mark uncertain text as needing verification
- preserve source structure only when it helps the final artifact

# Gotchas

- Do not force every artifact into the same outline.
- Do not overuse tables for narrative teaching content.
- Do not mix learner-facing text with reviewer notes.
- Do not assume Markdown rendering extensions unless the environment clearly supports them.
