# Purpose

Audit the quality of a course project before release or before the next production stage.

# QA dimensions

Review along these axes:

- scope completeness
- structural consistency
- learning-objective alignment
- content clarity
- lab executability
- learner/instructor material separation
- formatting and naming consistency
- release readiness

# Issue classification

Tag issues as one or more of:

- blocker
- major
- minor
- suggestion

And also by class:

- factual
- structural
- pedagogical
- operational
- formatting

# QA output structure

```markdown
# QA Review

## Scope reviewed
## Findings summary
## Detailed issues
## Risk assessment
## Release recommendation
```

# Review behavior

- Cite the artifact or section where each issue appears.
- Prefer evidence-based findings over vague quality opinions.
- Distinguish between “not ideal” and “not releasable”.

# Gotchas

- Do not convert QA into silent editing.
- Do not file cosmetic nits as blockers.
- Do not approve release if critical labs are unverified.
- Do not overlook cross-file inconsistency.
